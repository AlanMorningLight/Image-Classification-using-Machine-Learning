To execute CNN, run the file cnnTests.py after setting the following parameters,
1. trainDataLoc, testDataLoc on lines 34 and 35 with the relative path of the dataset folder
2. The model to run, i.e., arrangement 1 or arrangement 2 at line no 94
3. The final kaggle prediction fileName line 117, default=kagglePredictions.csv

Note: Depending on the model selected, this may take a while :p
