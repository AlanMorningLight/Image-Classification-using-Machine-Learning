# Image-Classification-using-Machine-Learning
This project was done as a part of the Applied Machine Learning Course (COMP 551) at McGill University and was done in a group of 3 students. The goal of the project was that given an image which contains 2 single digit number, predict the sum of those single digits. The data-set consisted of 100,000 gray scale images which contained 2 single digits, these images were formed by combining two different images from the very famous MNIST Dataset. Four algorithms were applied on this dataset- Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machine (SVM) Fully Connected Neural Network (NN) and Convolution Neural Network (CNN). We evaluated and discussed the results of these 4 algorithms on the dataset. It was observed that CNN performed best among the 4 algorithms which was not surprising as CNN is renowned to work well with images. My responsibility in this project included feature pre-processing and applying CNN. This project introduced me to the world of Deep Learning (read Keras, Tensorflows, GPU)
